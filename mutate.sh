# mutate.sh — a suite that cannot go red is not a suite.
#
# Every gate this project wrote passed something broken until it was mutation-tested:
#
#   the Python suite   goal_min 0.30 -> 0.45 changed NOTHING; weights reshuffled, nothing
#   drift-parity (TS)  the threshold could move anywhere inside 0.30..0.45 undetected
#   the Swift parity   a dropped stopword and a moved stem boundary each changed NOTHING
#   check-contrast     exempted hues, so a 1.97:1 call-to-action shipped green
#
# In every case the tests were green and the instrument was unprotected. Green is a claim
# about the tests, not about the code, and the only way to earn it is to break the code on
# purpose and watch the tests notice.
#
# This does that mechanically. Each mutation below changes ONE thing the product forbids
# changing silently. If the suite still passes, the suite is not watching that thing, and
# this exits non-zero.
#
#   ./mutate.sh          run every mutation
#   ./mutate.sh --deep   run them WITHOUT test_frozen.py
#   ./mutate.sh --list   show them without running
#
# --deep is the interesting mode. test_frozen.py pins the constants by value, so it
# catches every constant mutation by construction — a green run only proves that file
# exists. Excluding it asks the sharper question: does any test notice the CHANGE IN
# BEHAVIOUR, or is the instrument protected by one assertion of its own numbers? Both
# guarantees are worth having and they are not the same thing.

# Fixing the sed text to match 0.5.0's _D.get('goal_min', 0.30) refactor (see git blame)
# only got the patterns matching again — it did not make them mean anything. _D is built
# as `_G.get('calibration') or {}`, and _G is grammar.json. For every key grammar.json's
# calibration section actually sets — goal_min, self_report_min, stall_window, the three
# weights — the literal inside .get(key, LITERAL) is a fallback for a key that is never
# missing, so mutating it changes nothing that runs. Proved live: sed'ing the Python
# literal left test_frozen.py green; sed'ing the SAME value in grammar.json failed it in
# the same run. Only echo_min and dialogue_window are absent from grammar.json's
# calibration, so those two are the only ones the Python literal still governs.

# ── PRIVATE STATE ROOT, and this file needs it more than any other ──────────────────────
#
# This script runs the ENTIRE suite once per mutation, twice over (--deep repeats it), on
# deliberately broken constants. It is the single most pathological writer in the repo, and
# it was writing all of it into ~/.config/laserbrain — the corpus every published threshold
# is measured from.
#
# FOUND 2026-08-06 by test_corpus_clean, after the 0.45.0 release put 84 fixture contexts
# back into a corpus that had been quarantined clean four hours earlier. publish.sh was
# blamed and fixed the night before; the fix set LASERBRAIN_HOME at line 34 and this script
# is called from line 24. Ten lines too late, so the gate that runs first ran unprotected
# and undid the cleaning of the gate that runs second. 82 of the 84 were contexts I had
# already quarantined once.
#
# THE LESSON, which is why the export lives HERE and not in the caller: isolating a script
# from outside protects only the call sites someone remembered. A script that writes state
# should carry its own root, so it is isolated however it is invoked — by publish.sh, by
# run-tests.sh, or by hand.
#
# Deferring to an existing LASERBRAIN_HOME keeps it composable: under run-tests.sh the run
# shares that root rather than fragmenting into one per script.
