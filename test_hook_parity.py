"""test_hook_parity.py — the hook's copy of the progress rules must match observe.py's.

The Claude Code hook cannot import laserbrain: it runs against whatever python3 is on
PATH, and that interpreter has the PUBLISHED version from PyPI while observe.py lives in
the working tree. An import there fails on version skew, inside a process whose entire
job is to never break. So the rules are duplicated — deliberately, and dangerously.

This is the test that makes the duplication safe. It runs both implementations over
randomised traces and fails on the first disagreement. If it goes red, the two copies
have drifted apart, which is precisely the failure mode the product is named after.

# The old path now holds a shim that exits non-zero and says where to look, so this test
# went red the moment the file moved rather than quietly comparing against nothing. That
# was the point of the shim: a moved file should break what depends on it, loudly, instead
# of leaving it measuring air. A silent pass here would have meant the duplicated progress
# rules were ungated and nothing would have said so.
