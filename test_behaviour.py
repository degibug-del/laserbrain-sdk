"""test_behaviour.py — the calibration, watched by what it DOES.

`./mutate.sh --deep` asked the sharp question on 2026-07-25 and got a bad answer: with
test_frozen.py excluded, five of six mutations survived. Move goal_min from 0.30 to 0.45,
reweight Φ, raise the self-report floor, widen the stall window, deafen the echo detector
— every one of those changed real behaviour and NO test noticed. The entire protection was
one file asserting the numbers by value.

Pinning a constant and testing what it does are different guarantees. A pin says "this is
0.30". This file says "at 0.30 THIS input reads as advancing and THAT one reads as drift",
so the boundary cannot move without a verdict changing somewhere a test is looking.

Every case below straddles a boundary deliberately, with the straddling value measured
rather than guessed. That was the exact hole in the first cross-language parity vectors:
they had no case between 0.30 and 0.45, so the threshold could move anywhere inside that
band undetected.
