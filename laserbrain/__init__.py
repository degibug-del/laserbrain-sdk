laserbrain — attach the smart recursion harness to any agent loop.

The check is a pure function, so it runs LOCALLY and free (the open grammar, no
key, no latency). Give it a key and it also mirrors to the API for retained drift
history, alerts and the fleet view — you pay to *see* your agents drift, not for
the check. Model-agnostic: you provide the agent, laserbrain closes the loop.

    # NOT true of the other two: `distance` and `progress` are whatever the agent says
    # they are. On the published calibration that is 0.5 anchored and 0.5 self-report, and
    # nothing said so. An agent that simply reports its distance falling keeps Φ low while
    # doing nothing at all.
    #
    # So: 0.5 when only the ground is anchored, 1.0 when the self-reported terms are
    # corroborated by observed events since the last check. Reported, never folded into

    `check()` ended with a blocking POST to /v1/drift, commented "best-effort". It was not
    best-effort in any sense the caller could feel: profiling put 96% of check() inside
    urlopen, at ~135 ms against 869 us keyless — a 155x tax on the measurement, paid by
    every keyed check. A hung network would have paid the full 8-second timeout, so the
    instrument's worst case was the network's worst case.

    Mirroring is genuinely a side-effect: nothing in the verdict depends on it and the
    return value was discarded. So it belongs on a thread, and the only real requirements
    are the ones a naive `Thread(target=...)` per call would break:

    ORDER. One worker draining one queue, so the server sees the steps in the order they
    happened. A thread per post would race and scramble a run's history — worse than slow.

    BOUNDED. maxsize, and a full queue drops the OLDEST and counts it. A mirror that grows
    without limit while the network is down is a memory leak inside the thing that was
    supposed to cost nothing, and dropping the oldest keeps the most recent history — the
    part anyone is actually looking at.

    HONEST ON EXIT. Daemon thread, so it can never hang a process, plus an atexit drain
    with a short bound. Anything still queued after that is dropped and counted rather
    than waited on; `stats()` says so. Losing a mirrored row is acceptable, hanging
    somebody's script on exit is not.
