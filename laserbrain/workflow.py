"""workflow.py — an ordered process an agent runs, measured the whole way down.

WHAT WAS MISSING

laserbrain could already watch one agent on one goal (`Nova.run`) and N agents at once
(`compose`, `Supercode.manage`). It had nothing for the shape most actual work takes: an
ORDERED sequence of steps toward a single goal. That is not a third kind of loop, it is the
one shape where a specific failure lives — and the failure is the reason this file exists.

THE FAILURE IT CATCHES

A step that did something other than what the method declared it was for.

    goal: "ship the release"
      test    declared "the test suite passes"
              reported "the test suite passes"      ⟨pass|suite|test⟩ ⊂ ⟨releas|ship⟩   ok
      build   declared "build the release wheel"
              reported "refactoring the parser"     goal-drift, Φ 0.50                  caught

The step was declared FOR something, it reported doing something else, and the harness
scored the second against the first. That is a fact about this execution rather than an
inference — which matters, because the obvious-looking alternative does not work.

WHAT WAS TRIED FIRST, AND WHY IT WAS DROPPED

The first design compared each step's goal to the WORKFLOW's goal lexically, and reported
steps with little overlap as having wandered. The intended catch was four locally-green
steps that collectively abandoned the goal.

It cannot work, and no threshold rescues it. "the test suite passes" shares no words with
"ship the release" — and neither does "rewrite the documentation index". A legitimate step
and a wandering one are indistinguishable to word overlap, because a step SHOULD be phrased
differently from the goal it serves; restating the goal is what a step that does nothing
looks like. The first run flagged a healthy two-step release as wandering.

There is also a harder point underneath. If a workflow DECLARES a docs-rewrite step, that
step is the method — the author put it there. Nothing about the run is wrong; the method is.
Catching that is a question about a spec, not about an execution, and this file measures
executions.

HOW IT IS MEASURED

Each step gets its OWN harness, grounded on its DECLARED goal, and what the step reports is
scored against that. `parent_goal` carries the workflow's goal into every reading, so the
containment stays visible in the score:

    ⟨pass|suite|test⟩ advancing d1 ⊂ ⟨releas|ship⟩

One harness for the whole sequence does not work either, and that was also measured rather
than assumed: it grounds on step one, so a four-step release reads grounded · goal-drift ·
goal-drift · goal-drift, and the second step was "build the wheel". Per-step grounding is
the same resolution supercode uses for agents.


WHAT MAKES IT AGENT-NATIVE RATHER THAN A PIPELINE

1. A step declares a GOAL, not just a command. Something with no goal cannot be scored, and
   a step that cannot be scored is one the workflow cannot tell you about.
2. It halts on drift instead of running to the end and reporting. A process that keeps
   spending after it has left its goal is the exact thing the instrument is for.
3. Irreversible steps go through the Operator, so "deploy" and "run the tests" are not the
   same kind of thing. A pipeline treats them identically; the sixth layer does not.
4. The workflow is itself measured, so it can be asked whether IT drifted — the same
   discipline `Supercode.self_check()` applies to the supervisor.

                          more often — and reported so the disagreement is visible, not
                          because it is wrong.

        a commit and push went out on a red build (verify-before-record); 0.12.0 was
        published against a wheel built before the code existed (record/verify then act);
        a grammar sync was left uncommitted and a rewrite discarded it (change-is-recorded).

        Advisory, like the rest of lint. grammar-bump legitimately has no `act` at all, and
        a read-only method needs no `record` — the linter says what is missing and the
        author decides whether it matters.
