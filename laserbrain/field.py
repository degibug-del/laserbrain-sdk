"""field.py — read position from laserfield, so the brain stops guessing it.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. laserbrain's displacement has three terms and software can only
honestly supply two. There is no signal in a tool trace for "how far from done", so
`distance` is spelled by the agent or left as None — and None means a lower-bound Φ and no
stall detector at all. laserbeast does not have this problem: distance is metres. The
field is the virtual equivalent — a state space with a position in it.

WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT MEASURE. Be exact, because the tempting overclaim is right
here. The field emits weather: heat, moisture, rain, vitality, stress, rotation. Those are
NOT your task's completion. What this computes is how far the FIELD has moved from where
it was when you grounded — context displacement, not progress.

    field displacement  =  has the world around the work changed
    task distance       =  how much of the work is left

They are different quantities and conflating them would be the exact overclaim this
project keeps refusing. So `context_distance()` is offered as its own reading, and it is
honest to pass it as `distance=` in ONE case: when the goal is to hold a position in the
field — a daemon, a monitor, an agent whose job is stability rather than completion. For
everything else, read it alongside Φ, not into it.

FAILS OPEN, ALWAYS. A dead daemon returns None, never a number. A monitor that blocks the
thing it monitors is worse than no monitor, and a fabricated distance is worse than an
absent one — absent is a lower bound, fabricated is a lie with a decimal point.
