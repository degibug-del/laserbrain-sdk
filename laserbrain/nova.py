"""nova — the laserbrain agent.

    from laserbrain import Nova

    n = Nova(goal='ship the parser and the benchmark')
    n.learn('search', my_search_fn)
    n.run(act)                      # act(ctx) -> {goal, progress, distance, done?}

    n.use('supercode', observations=[...])   # the supervision skill, preloaded

WHAT NOVA IS, AND IS NOT
------------------------
nova is the thing that DOES work. Everything else in this package measures work, manages
it, records it or proves things about it — laserbrain is a reference, lasergear is
instructions, laserstore is the record. None of them act. nova is the actor, and it is the
only object here with agency.

It is a scaffold, not an intelligence. The thinking arrives as `act` — a callable that is
usually a model. What nova supplies is the loop, the skills, and the instrumentation: an
agent that wears the harness natively instead of being asked to remember it. Coverage on
hand-instrumented runs sits near 12%; an agent that cannot skip the check has coverage 1.

WHY IT DOES NOT GROUND ITSELF — AND WHAT THAT CLAIM IS WORTH
------------------------------------------------------------
No method here sets, moves or clears the ground. `Harness` freezes it at the first check
and nova offers no way to touch it. An agent that can revise the reference it is measured
against is measuring itself, which PROOF rules out and which every self-referential monitor
gets wrong the same way.

But the first version of this file said nova "holds no handle to it", and that was false.
`nova._hz._run.ground` is reachable and writable — the check behind the claim had been
`dir()` for method names containing "ground", which tests the vocabulary and not the
object. In Python nothing is truly private, so a barrier is not on offer.

What IS on offer is detection. The ground is fingerprinted at the first check and verified
whenever nova reports. Tampering does not raise — it is recorded, because a monitor that
crashes gets removed and a monitor that tells you gets read. `ground_intact()` answers it
directly, and `report()` says so in the open.

nova is measured BY laserbrain. It never measures itself. `self_check()` returns the
harness's verdict, unmodified — nova is not permitted to have an opinion about it.

SKILLS, AND WHY supercode IS ONE
--------------------------------
A skill is a capability nova can invoke. supercode is preloaded because supervising other
agents is a thing an agent DOES, not a thing an instrument is — it reads across agents,
finds collisions, and recommends who yields. nova calls it; nova is not it.

Every skill call is recorded as an Event. That matters beyond bookkeeping: the events feed
`catches`, so nova's claims can be checked against nova's actions by something that is not
nova.
