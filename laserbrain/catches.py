"""Catch signatures — drift in how an agent VERIFIES, not in what it says it is doing.

PROTOTYPE, 2026-07-27. Not exported from __init__ and not published; the eight modes
are the product, this is a second axis being tried out.

The eight modes read the state an agent spells for itself. That is self-report, and
laserbrain's own documentation says self-report is the weak signal — an agent that is
confidently wrong spells a perfectly grounded state. Everything here is computed from
OBSERVED events instead: what tools returned, whether a check ever failed, whether code
was executed before being described. An agent cannot spell its way past any of it.

All six signatures from phronesis-world/PROTOCOL.md are implemented. Three read an event
log — unfalsified, instrument_blind, unrun — and are reachable through catches(). The
other three need an input an event log does not carry, so they are called directly:
residue takes a transform, contaminated takes a piece of output, stale_gate takes a gate
and a mutation. Every one has a test that fires on the incident that produced it and a
test that stays silent on the clean case.
