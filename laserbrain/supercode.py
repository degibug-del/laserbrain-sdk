"""supercode — an agent for agents. It watches, scores, and writes. It never acts.

    from laserbrain import Supercode

    sc = Supercode(goal='ship the parser and the benchmark')
    sc.observe('claude', goal='write a JSON parser', progress='advancing', distance=4)
    sc.observe('grok',   goal='benchmark the cache',  progress='stuck',     distance=7)
    print(sc.report())        # what every agent is doing, scored
    sc.publish()              # the same findings, written into the link

WHY IT ONLY ADVISES. laserbrain's whole claim is that it is a monitor, not a planner —
an outside reference an agent cannot fool, which never tells it what to do next. A
supervisor with authority to reground would break that in the one place it matters most,
because the supervisor cannot see the work either. It sees the same three fields the
agent spelled. Handing that reading command authority makes it a planner with less
information than the planner it overrides.

So supercode writes to the link and the agents read it. An agent told it is oscillating
knows something it could not know alone — the shape of its own sequence — and decides
for itself what that means.

TWO THINGS THAT MAKE IT LASERBRAIN RATHER THAN AN ORCHESTRATOR.

One: it runs under its own instrument. Its goal is "keep N agents on their grounds",
which is a goal the harness can score, so the supervisor is measured by the thing it
applies. `sc.self_check()` returns supercode's own verdict. A supervisor that has drifted
is worse than none, and this is the only way it can find out.

Two: it judges on OBSERVED events, not on self-report. Each agent gets its own Harness —
so its ground is its own first goal, not the supervisor's — and `catches` reads what an
agent's tools actually returned. laserbrain's own docs call self-report the weak signal;
a supervisor built on self-report inherits that weakness N times over.

        findings() already runs the six catches over each agent's own events. The first
        version of this method re-ran three of them over the pooled log and reported the
        results as fleet findings, which was mostly duplication: a test showed per-agent
        `unfalsified` and `unrun` had already fired on the same evidence. Two of the three
        "supervisor-only" catches were the supervisor repeating what everyone already knew.

        So this reports only where fleet evidence CHANGES the per-agent answer, and it does
        so in both directions — because more evidence can exonerate as easily as accuse:

        blind_fleet     one tool returning an identical result to agents doing DIFFERENT
                        work. instrument_blind sees repetition within one log and cannot

                        known to differ, so an identical answer means the tool is not
                        reading its input. No single agent can compute this.

        thin_evidence   a check green everywhere and red nowhere, where NO agent has seen
                        enough of it to trigger unfalsified alone. Three passes is a weak
                        sample; thirty across six agents with no red is a gate that cannot
                        fail. Suppressed when a per-agent catch already fired — that is
                        already reported and does not need saying twice.

        unrun_cleared   the useful inversion. Per-agent `unrun` fires when the claiming
                        agent never executed what it claimed. If ANOTHER agent did execute
                        it, the claim is backed and the per-agent catch is a false positive

        fields and the agent sees the work: a supervisor that regrounds mid-run is a

        {name: ctx} when every agent is finished, halted or the ceiling is hit.

        WHAT MANAGING MEANS HERE, EXACTLY
        ---------------------------------
        Three powers, each with a reason it is allowed:

        1. ASSIGN and HALT on collision. Two agents on one ground is a fact no agent can
           observe — each is perfectly grounded and correct at every step. The supervisor
           holds strictly more information than either, so it may stop the duplication. It
           halts the yielding agent and says why; it does NOT hand it a new goal, because
           it has no basis for one.

        2. INJECT the agent's own verdict. On drift, ctx['return'] carries the advice the
           agent's OWN harness produced against its OWN frozen ground. Supercode is the
           courier, not the author — it is not substituting its judgment for the agent's,
           it is delivering a reading the agent cannot take from inside.

        3. ESCALATE to a human. When drift persists for `escalate_after` steps, the human
           decides and their decision overrides. Authority goes UP to a person, never
           sideways to the supervisor.

        WHAT IT STILL WILL NOT DO
        -------------------------
        Reground a running agent — tell it what its goal now is. Supercode sees three
        spelled fields; the agent sees the work. A supervisor that regrounds mid-run is a
        planner overriding a better-informed planner, and every reading it makes afterward
        is measured against a reference it chose itself, which is the self-referential
        monitor PROOF forbids. Halting is not regrounding: stopping an agent leaves the
        decision about what happens next with whoever reads the report.
