"""link — many agents, one shared log.

This shipped as `tandem` and was described as a two-agent channel: Claude and Grok, one
JSONL between them. The record format was never two-agent — every line already carries
an `agent` field — so the limit lived in the documentation and the tool names, not in the
data. Renamed and generalised 2026-07-27 on Diego's instruction: link has to be multiple
agents.

    from laserbrain import link_write, link_read, link_agents

    link_write('parser done, handing over the benchmark', kind='handoff')
    link_agents()          # everyone who has spoken on this link
    link_read(agent='grok', limit=5)

The link carries DATA about the work. The field carries the weather. The harness carries
the goal. Three different shared things, and conflating them is the mistake this project
keeps declining to make.

Local by default — a JSONL under ~/.config/laserbrain. Nothing here needs a key or a
network, so a link works between agents on one machine with no account at all.

    two agents "sharing" a channel each write to a different log and each reads an empty
    one, which presents exactly as the other agent having said nothing. The legacy path is
