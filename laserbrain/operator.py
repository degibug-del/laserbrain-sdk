"""operator.py — the sixth layer, as something nova can hold.

Named in grammar 1.8.0 on 2026-07-28. The other five layers measure, instruct, serve,
define and record; the operator is the only one that ACTS on the world. That is the whole
reason it needed a name of its own rather than being filed under lasergear as "tools".

WHY IT IS A LAYER

The grammar sets the test: a part is real when it has a failure mode none of the others
share. Every other failure is recoverable by correction — a wrong reading is re-taken, an
absent instruction supplied, an unreachable server retried, a mismatched copy re-synced, a
lost record rebuilt. The operator's is not. A sent message is sent. A deleted file is
deleted. It fails by being IRREVERSIBLE.

WHAT THIS MODULE ACTUALLY ENFORCES

One rule, from the layer's own `may_not` clause:

    take an irreversible or outward-facing action without authorization from the person,
    per action and per session

Three things follow, and each is a deliberate choice rather than an implementation detail:

1. DEFAULT IS DENY. An Operator built with no authorizer refuses every irreversible action.
   The alternative — proceed unless someone objects — puts the burden on the person who is
   not in the loop, which is the situation the layer exists to describe.

2. APPROVAL DOES NOT CACHE. Every irreversible act asks, every time, even for an identical
   action approved a moment ago. "Per action and per session" is the strict reading and the
   safe one: caching by fingerprint would let one approval cover a repeat the person never
   saw. A loop that deletes a thousand files would ask once. That is the failure this rule
   is for.

3. REFUSAL IS RECORDED, NOT SILENT. Every act — taken, refused, or failed — lands in `log`.
   An operator that blocked something and said nothing is indistinguishable from one that
   was never called, which is the same "silence is not success" problem the harness has
   everywhere else.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO

It does not decide what is reversible. The caller declares that, because only the caller
knows what the callable actually does — a guard that inferred reversibility from a string
would be guessing, and guessing in this direction is exactly the wrong way to be wrong.
Declaring nothing means `reversible=False`, so an undeclared action is treated as
irreversible and asks.

It is also not a sandbox. Python offers no true barrier and this class does not pretend to
be one: `op._authorize = lambda a: True` is one line away for anything running in-process.
It is the same posture as `Nova.ground_intact()` — evidence rather than a wall. What it
guarantees is that taking an irreversible action without asking cannot happen BY ACCIDENT,
and that if it happens deliberately the log says so.
