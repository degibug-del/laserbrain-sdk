"""The ICM Reading contract, agent side.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. "Integrated Coherence Model" has been describing something true and
unenforced: laserbrain reads agents, the phronesis surfaces read people, both implement
displacement from a reference that cannot be revised, and they share no code. Two
implementations of one idea that have never been made to agree is the condition that let
`coherence` mean three different numbers on the site, and that nearly let read() diverge
between the site and the Worker before check-reading-parity caught it.

So the shape is declared once — phronesis-world/lib/icm-reading.ts — and both sides are
gated against it by scripts/check-reading-contract.mjs.

WHAT IS NOT SHARED, deliberately: the computation. Phi is
0.5*jaccard(goal) + 0.3*|delta d|/10 + 0.2*(progress changed); the human side is 100 minus
a keyword tally. Those SHOULD differ. An agent spells its state against a goal it declared;
a person writes prose about how they are. Forcing one formula onto both would be the same
error as averaging Dialogue's four facts into a single coupling score.

WHY DISPLACEMENT IS PHI * 100 AND NOT SOMETHING TIDIER: phi is already the displacement
this instrument measures, on 0..1, and rescaling is the only honest conversion. Deriving a
different number here would create a third quantity nobody calibrated — which is exactly
how `coherence` came to mean three things.
