"""The whole thing, wired together.

One author writes a method and stores it. A different agent — with no access to the
author's code — vends it, binds its OWN skills to the declared steps, and runs it under
measurement with the operator gating whatever cannot be taken back.

That path is the product. Each piece has its own tests; this asserts they compose.
