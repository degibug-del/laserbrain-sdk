# release.sh — bump, build, publish, commit, tag. Run this yourself; it asks for the token.
#
#   ./release.sh 0.52.0
#
# WHY YOU RUN IT AND NOT AN ASSISTANT. The PyPI token is a credential. It is prompted for
# here with `read -s`, never passed as an argument, never written to a file, and never
# echoed — so it does not enter shell history, a process list, or a transcript.
#
# WHY THE ORDER IS BUMP → PUBLISH → COMMIT, AND NOT BUMP → COMMIT → PUBLISH.
# The phronesis-world build gate `check-laserbrain-parity.mjs` asserts that the version in
# this repo matches the version live on PyPI. A commit that bumps ahead of a successful
# upload therefore breaks the site build until the upload lands. Publishing first means the
# window where they disagree is measured in seconds and never survives a commit.

The frozen ground is returned on every verdict rather than only on a firing
goal-drift. Measured: unconditional re-presentation takes rule survival across
relayed hand-offs from 0/8 chains to 8/8, with no detector in the loop; a generic
reminder to honour standing rules, fired just as often, scores 0/6.

Published to PyPI before this commit, so the repo version and the live version
never disagree in a commit — check-laserbrain-parity.mjs asserts they match."
